* Bayesian classificators implementation. 
* Hypothesis based classificators implementation. 
* Parameter(Linear, quadratic) classificators implementation. 
* Waldo's Sequantial hypothesis test
* Maximum Likelihood and K-Mean clusterizations algorithms
* Known output classificators


2. Speech recognition using:
* Short term energy and Zero crossing count for word segmentation
* Pitch frequency estimation, implementing paralel process and a autocorrelation estimator.
* Implementations of delta and compounding quantizers. 
* LPC coeffs. as features
* K-Nearest Neighbour for classification
