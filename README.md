A repository that contains assignments from two fourth year courses from School of Electrical Engineering University of Belgrade

1. Speech recognition using:
* Short term energy and Zero crossing count for word segmentation
* LPC coeffs. as features
* K-Nearest Neighbour for classification

2. Classification algortihm implementations:
* Bayesian classificators
* Parameter(Linear, quadratic) classificators
* Waldo's Sequantial hypothesis test
* Maximum Likelihood and K-Mean clusterizations algorithms
* Known output classificators
